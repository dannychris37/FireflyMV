# FireflyMV
AES Trucklab Firefly camera code

All code that is compiled can be found in `grab_FireFlyMV.c` and inside the `grab_FireFlyMV` dir.

`readings` shows some output from when the cameras detect one or more moving markers.

`old code` has the code from when it was in a single file.

The rest are utility files.
